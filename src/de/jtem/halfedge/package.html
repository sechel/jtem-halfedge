<h3>Cell decompositions of surfaces</h3>

Half-edge data structures are used primarily to represent cell decompositions of oriented surfaces.
<p>
<small>We say "primarily" because half-edge data structures can be used to represent somewhat more 
general combinatorial structures, such as, for example, a checker board surface with white squares removed.
</small>
<p>
Here, <i>surface</i> means <i>two-dimensional manifold, possibly with boundary</i>; 
and a <i>cell decomposition of a surface</i> is a graph embedded in the surface such that the 
complement of the graph is (topologically) a disjoint union of open disks.
The term <i>map on a surface</i> means the same. 
Thus, a cell decomposition decomposes a surface into <i>vertices</i>, <i>edges</i>, and <i>faces</i>.

<h3>Regular and strongly regular</h3>

A cell decomposition of a surface is called <i>regular</i>, if it has no loops (edges with the same vertex 
on both ends), and if the boundary of a face contains an edge or vertex at most once. It is called
<i>strongly regular</i> if two edges have at most one vertex in common, and if two faces have at most 
one edge or one vertex in common. A strongly regular cell decomposition is usually called a <i>mesh</i>.

<h3>This half-edge data structure implementation</h3>

This half-edge data structure implementation consists of different types of objects representing vertices, 
half-edges, and faces.
The term <i>half-edge</i> can and should be thought of as synonymous with <i>oriented edge</i> 
or <i>directed edge</i>. 
<p>
Every half-edge object holds references to: <br>
<br>
&bull; its oppositely oriented companion edge<br>
&bull; the next edge in the boundary of the face on its left hand side<br>
&bull; the previous edge in the boundary of the face on its left hand side<br>
&bull; the face on its left hand side<br>
&bull; the vertex it points to.<br>
<br>
The face and vertex objects hold back references to a half-edge referencing them. 

<p>
Finally, there is the class {@link de.jtem.halfedge.HalfEdgeDataStructure} representing a whole half-edge 
data structure. It acts as a container for (and sort of factory of) its vertices, edges, and faces. 

<h3>Use of generics</h3>

Typically, one wants to equip vertices, edges, and faces with additional properties or functionality.
For example, vertices may have coordinates associated with them, edges may have weights, and
faces may have colors.
<p>
Our half-edge data structure facilitates this by using generic classes as abstract base classes 
for vertex, edge, and face types: The classes {@link de.jtem.halfedge.Vertex}, {@link de.jtem.halfedge.Edge}, 
{@link de.jtem.halfedge.Face} are all parameterized with the associated vertex, edge, and face types.
<p>
<b>Example.</b> To create a half-edge data structure with vertices that have 2D coordinates, proceed as follows.<br>
<br>
&bull; Step 1. Define appropriate subclasses of {@link de.jtem.halfedge.Vertex}, {@link de.jtem.halfedge.Edge}, 
{@link de.jtem.halfedge.Face}, for example: <br>
<br>
{@code public class MyVertex extends Vertex<MyVertex, MyEdge, MyFace> {public Point2D p;}}<br>
{@code public class MyEdge extends Edge<MyVertex, MyEdge, MyFace> {} }<br>
{@code public class MyFace extends Face<MyVertex, MyEdge, MyFace> {} }<br>
<br>
(Of course you might make the property <code>p</code> of <code>MyEdge</code> private and provide getter and setter methods, etc.)
Note that you always have to subclass  {@link de.jtem.halfedge.Vertex}, {@link de.jtem.halfedge.Edge}, 
and {@link de.jtem.halfedge.Face}, even if you do not define any additional functionality or properties. <br>
<br>	
&bull; Step 2. Instantiate a {@link de.jtem.halfedge.HalfEdgeDataStructure}:<br>
<br>
{@code HalfEdgeDataStructure<MyVertex,MyEdge,MyFace> heds = new  HalfEdgeDataStructure<MyVertex,MyEdge,MyFace>(MyVertex.class, MyEdge.class, MyFace.class);}<br>
<br> 
The parameters of the constructor serve as run time type tokens. <br>
<br>
&bull; Step 3. Instantiate vertices, edges, and faces using {@link de.jtem.halfedge.HalfEdgeDataStructure#addNewVertex() addNewVertex()}, 
{@link de.jtem.halfedge.HalfEdgeDataStructure#addNewEdge() addNewEdge()}, and {@link de.jtem.halfedge.HalfEdgeDataStructure#addNewFace() addNewFace()},
like this:<br>
<br>
{@code MyVertex v = heds.addNewVertex();}<br>
{@code MyEdge e = heds.addNewEdge();}<br>
{@code MyFace f = heds.addNewFace();}<br>
